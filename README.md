# What Is QuickTransfer?
#### Quick Transfer Is A Tool Written In Python3 That Allows The User To Download Youtube Playlists , Youtube Videos & Other Files And Access The Downloaded Files In A Web Browser
# Why?
#### 1. Because There Are No Other Tools That I Know Of That Can Download Youtube Playlists & Youtube Videos
#### 2. There Are A Lot Of Age Restricted Videos On Youtube For No Reason So I Made This So I Could Watch Them Without Using Using Online MP4 Downloaders That Don't Work Half Of The Time
